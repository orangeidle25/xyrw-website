    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 17/11/2025</p>
    <p>This Discord bot ("xyrw") is a custom application designed for a single server ("xyrw"). The Bot is not intended for public use and cannot be added to your own server. You may note that this policy is a requirement for Discord bot verification, so it is not really needed.</p>
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The Bot collects the following data during the verification process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Username</li>
        <li>User ID</li>
        <li>Banner</li>
        <li>Profile picture</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Use of Data</h2>
    <p>The collected data is used for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Verification and management of user access to the Server</li>
        <li>Adding users to alternative servers in case the Server is terminated</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Data Protection</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the collected data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
    <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time. Changes will be effective immediately and will be posted on this page. You may not be notified.</p>
